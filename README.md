# php-message-board
This a learning repository for me to learn object oriented PHP.

You have to specify the following env variables:

- DB_HOST
- DB_USER
- DB_PASSWORD
- DB_NAME

## My disclaimer
Be warned this is only a learning project. All code residing in this project and or repo is my attempt to learn 
how to build websites with OOP and PHP and database persistence.  
So it is possible that some code maybe not best practice or standard.
