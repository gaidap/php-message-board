# php-message-board
This a learning repository for me to learn object oriented PHP.

You have to specify the following env variables on your server:

- DB_HOST
- DB_USER
- DB_PASSWORD
- DB_NAME

And also you have to create a database with the name specified in DB_NAME.  
You will have to create the schema by yourself, you can youse the exported sql files inside /schema.  
  
Have fun!

## My disclaimer
Be warned this is only a learning project. All code residing in this project and or repo is my attempt to learn 
how to build websites with OOP and PHP and database persistence.  
So it is possible that some code maybe not best practice or standard.
